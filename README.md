# Smart-Medication-Reminder
The Smart Medication Reminder project aims to help users manage their medication schedules with ease and efficiency. This app will provide reminders for users to take their prescribed medications, track their progress, and ensure they never miss a dose. The solution will be built with a backend service to handle reminders and notification.
